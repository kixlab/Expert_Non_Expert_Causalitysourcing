<p>Korea was <a href="/wiki/Korea_under_Japanese_rule" title="Korea under Japanese rule">ruled by Imperial Japan</a> from 1910 until the closing days of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. In August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Imperial <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, as a result of an agreement with the United States, and liberated Korea north of the <a href="/wiki/38th_parallel_north" title="38th parallel north">38th parallel</a>. U.S. forces subsequently moved into the south. By 1948, as a product of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, Korea was <a href="/wiki/Division_of_Korea" title="Division of Korea">split</a> into two regions, with separate governments. Both claimed to be the legitimate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces—supported by the Soviet Union and China—moved into the south on 25 June 1950.<sup id="cite_ref-Devine_2007_819-821_43-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Devine_2007_819-821-43">[41]</a></sup> On 27 June, the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a> authorized <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_83" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 83">the formation and dispatch of UN forces to Korea</a> to repel what <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_82" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 82">was recognized</a> as a North Korean invasion.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[42]</a></sup> Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force, with the United States providing 88% of the UN's military personnel.</p>

<p>After the first two months of war, South Korean and U.S. forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat, forced back to a small area in the south known as the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Pusan_Perimeter" title="Battle of Pusan Perimeter">Pusan Perimeter</a>. In September 1950, an amphibious UN counter-offensive was launched at <a href="/wiki/Incheon" title="Incheon">Incheon</a>, and cut off many North Korean troops. Those who escaped envelopment and capture were forced back north. UN forces rapidly approached the <a href="/wiki/Yalu_River" title="Yalu River">Yalu River—</a>the border with China—but in October 1950, mass Chinese forces crossed the Yalu and entered the war.<sup id="cite_ref-Devine_2007_819-821_43-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Devine_2007_819-821-43">[41]</a></sup> The surprise Chinese intervention triggered a retreat of UN forces which continued until mid-1951.</p>

<p>After these reversals of fortune, which saw <a href="/wiki/Seoul" title="Seoul">Seoul</a> change hands four times, the last two years of fighting became a <a href="/wiki/Attrition_warfare" title="Attrition warfare">war of attrition</a>, with the front line close to the 38th parallel. The war in the air, however, was never a stalemate. North Korea was subject to a massive bombing campaign. <a href="/wiki/Jet_fighters" class="mw-redirect" title="Jet fighters">Jet fighters</a> confronted each other in <a href="/wiki/Air-to-air_combat" class="mw-redirect" title="Air-to-air combat">air-to-air combat</a> for the first time in history, and Soviet pilots covertly flew in defense of their communist allies.</p>

<p>The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when an <a href="/wiki/Korean_Armistice_Agreement" title="Korean Armistice Agreement">armistice</a> was signed. The agreement created the <a href="/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone" title="Korean Demilitarized Zone">Korean Demilitarized Zone</a> to separate North and South Korea, and allowed the return of prisoners. However, no <a href="/wiki/Peace_treaty" title="Peace treaty">peace treaty</a> has been signed, and the two Koreas are <a href="/wiki/Frozen_conflict" title="Frozen conflict">technically still at war</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-HeFeng2013_45-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HeFeng2013-45">[43]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-LiCribb2014_46-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LiCribb2014-46">[44]</a></sup></p>

<p>As a war undeclared by all participants, the conflict helped bring the term "<a href="/wiki/Police_action" title="Police action">police action</a>" into common use. It also led to the permanent alteration of the balance of power within the United Nations, where Resolution 377—passed in 1950 to allow a bypassing of the Security Council if that body could not reach an agreement—led to the General Assembly displacing the Security Council as the primary organ of the UN.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[45]</a></sup></p>
