<p>Because neither Korea had a significant navy, the Korean War featured few naval battles. A skirmish between North Korea and the UN Command occurred on 2 July 1950; the U.S. Navy cruiser <a href="/wiki/USS_Juneau_(CL-119)" title="USS Juneau (CL-119)">USS&nbsp;<i>Juneau</i></a>, the Royal Navy cruiser <a href="/wiki/HMS_Jamaica_(44)" title="HMS Jamaica (44)">HMS&nbsp;<i>Jamaica</i></a>, and the frigate <a href="/wiki/HMS_Black_Swan_(L57)" title="HMS Black Swan (L57)">HMS&nbsp;<i>Black Swan</i></a> fought four North Korean torpedo boats and two mortar gunboats, and sank them. USS <i>Juneau</i> later sank several ammunition ships that had been present. The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred at Inchon, days before the Battle of Incheon; the ROK ship <i>PC-703</i> sank a North Korean mine layer in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Haeju" title="Battle of Haeju">Battle of Haeju</a> Island, near Inchon. Three other supply ships were sunk by <i>PC-703</i> two days later in the <a href="/wiki/Yellow_Sea" title="Yellow Sea">Yellow Sea</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Marolda2003_295-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Marolda2003-295">[292]</a></sup> Thereafter, vessels from the UN nations held undisputed control of the sea about Korea. The gun ships were used in shore bombardment, while the aircraft carriers provided air support to the ground forces.</p>

<p>During most of the war, the UN navies patrolled the west and east coasts of North Korea, sinking supply and ammunition ships and denying the North Koreans the ability to resupply from the sea. Aside from very occasional gunfire from North Korean shore batteries, the main threat to United States and UN navy ships was from <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_mine" class="mw-redirect" title="Magnetic mine">magnetic mine</a>s. During the war, five U.S. Navy ships were lost to mines: two minesweepers, two minesweeper escorts, and one ocean tug. Mines and gunfire from North Korean coastal artillery damaged another 87 U.S. warships, resulting in slight to moderate damage.<sup id="cite_ref-296" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-296">[293]</a></sup></p>
