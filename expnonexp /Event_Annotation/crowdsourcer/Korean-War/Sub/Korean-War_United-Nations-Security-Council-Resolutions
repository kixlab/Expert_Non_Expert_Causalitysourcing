<p>On 25 June 1950, the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a> unanimously condemned the North Korean invasion of the Republic of Korea, with <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_82" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 82">UN Security Council Resolution 82</a>. The Soviet Union, a <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power" title="United Nations Security Council veto power">veto-wielding power</a>, had boycotted the Council meetings since January 1950, protesting that the Taiwanese "<a href="/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Republic of China</a>" and not the mainland "People's Republic of China" <a href="/wiki/China_and_the_United_Nations" title="China and the United Nations">held a permanent seat</a> in the UN Security Council.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMalkasian200116_134-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMalkasian200116-134">[132]</a></sup> After debating the matter, the Security Council, on 27 June 1950, published <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_83" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 83">Resolution 83</a> recommending member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea. On 27 June <a href="/wiki/Harry_S._Truman" title="Harry S. Truman">President Truman</a> ordered U.S. air and sea forces to help the South Korean regime. On 4 July the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister accused the United States of starting armed intervention on behalf of South Korea.<sup id="cite_ref-Gromyko1950_135-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gromyko1950-135">[133]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Soviet Union challenged the legitimacy of the war for several reasons. The ROK Army intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from U.S. Intelligence; North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of the UN, which violated UN Charter Article 32; and the fighting was beyond the UN Charter's scope, because the initial north-south border fighting was classed as a civil war. Because the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council at the time, legal scholars posited that deciding upon an action of this type required the unanimous vote of all the six permanent members including the Soviet Union.<sup id="cite_ref-Gross1951_136-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gross1951-136">[134]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Schick1950_137-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Schick1950-137">[135]</a></sup></p>

<p>Within days of the invasion, masses of ROK Army soldiers—of dubious loyalty to the Syngman Rhee regime—were retreating southwards or <a href="/wiki/Defection" title="Defection">defecting</a> en masse to the northern side, the KPA.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStokesbury199023_58-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStokesbury199023-58">[56]</a></sup></p>
