<p>In a postwar analysis of the unpreparedness of U.S. Army forces deployed to Korea during the summer and fall of 1950, Army Major General <a href="/wiki/Floyd_L._Parks" class="mw-redirect" title="Floyd L. Parks">Floyd L. Parks</a> stated that "Many who never lived to tell the tale had to fight the full range of ground warfare from offensive to delaying action, unit by unit, man by man ... [T]hat we were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat ... does not relieve us from the blame of having placed our own flesh and blood in such a predicament."<sup id="cite_ref-275" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-275">[272]</a></sup></p>

<p>By 1950, U.S. Secretary of Defense <a href="/wiki/Louis_A._Johnson" title="Louis A. Johnson">Louis A. Johnson</a> had established a policy of faithfully following President Truman's defense economization plans, and had aggressively attempted to implement it even in the face of steadily increasing external threats. He consequently received much of the blame for the initial setbacks in Korea and the widespread reports of ill-equipped and inadequately trained U.S. military forces in the war's early stages.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_276-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-276">[273]</a></sup></p>

<p>As an initial response to the invasion, Truman called for a naval blockade of North Korea, and was shocked to learn that such a blockade could be imposed only "on paper", since the U.S. Navy no longer had the warships with which to carry out his request.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBlair2003_277-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair2003-277">[274]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-blockade_278-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-blockade-278">[275]</a></sup> Army officials, desperate for weaponry, recovered <a href="/wiki/Sherman_tank" class="mw-redirect" title="Sherman tank">Sherman tanks</a> from World War II Pacific battlefields and reconditioned them for shipment to Korea.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_276-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-276">[273]</a></sup> Army Ordnance officials at Fort Knox pulled down <a href="/wiki/M26_Pershing" title="M26 Pershing">M26 Pershing</a> tanks from display pedestals around Fort Knox in order to equip the third company of the Army's hastily formed <a href="/wiki/70th_Tank_Battalion" class="mw-redirect" title="70th Tank Battalion">70th Tank Battalion</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-279" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-279">[276]</a></sup> Without adequate numbers of tactical fighter-bomber aircraft, the Air Force took <a href="/wiki/P-51_Mustang" class="mw-redirect" title="P-51 Mustang">F-51 (P-51)</a> propeller-driven aircraft out of storage or from existing <a href="/wiki/Air_National_Guard" title="Air National Guard">Air National Guard</a> squadrons, and rushed them into front-line service.

<p>Army Reserve and Army National Guard infantry soldiers and new inductees called to duty to fill out understrength infantry divisions found themselves short of nearly everything needed to repel the North Korean forces: artillery, ammunition, heavy tanks, ground-support aircraft, even effective anti-tank weapons such as the M20 3.5-inch (89&nbsp;mm) <a href="/wiki/Bazooka#Rocket_Launcher.2C_M20_.22Super_Bazooka.22" title="Bazooka">Super Bazooka</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-281" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-281">[278]</a></sup> Some Army combat units sent to Korea were supplied with worn out, 'red-lined' M-1 rifles or carbines in immediate need of ordnance depot overhaul or repair.<sup id="cite_ref-282" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-282">[279]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-283" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-283">[280]</a></sup> Only the Marine Corps, whose commanders had stored and maintained their World War II surplus inventories of equipment and weapons, proved ready for deployment, though they still were woefully under-strength,<sup id="cite_ref-284" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-284">[281]</a></sup> as well as in need of suitable landing craft to practice amphibious operations (Johnson had transferred most of the remaining craft to the Navy and reserved them for use in training Army units).<sup id="cite_ref-Shipmate2000_285-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shipmate2000-285">[282]</a></sup></p>

<p>Due to public criticism of his handling of the Korean War, Truman decided to ask for Johnson's resignation. On September 19, 1950, Johnson resigned as Secretary of Defense, and the president quickly replaced him with <a href="/wiki/General_of_the_Army" class="mw-redirect" title="General of the Army">General of the Army</a> <a href="/wiki/George_C._Marshall" class="mw-redirect" title="George C.
