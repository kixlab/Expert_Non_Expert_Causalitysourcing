<p>The <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Osan" title="Battle of Osan">Battle of Osan</a>, the first significant U.S. engagement of the Korean War, involved the 540-soldier Task Force Smith, which was a small forward element of the <a href="/wiki/24th_Infantry_Division_(United_States)" title="24th Infantry Division (United States)">24th Infantry Division</a> which had been flown in from Japan.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStokesbury199045_148-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStokesbury199045-148">[146]</a></sup> On 5 July 1950, Task Force Smith attacked the North Koreans at <a href="/wiki/Osan" title="Osan">Osan</a> but without weapons capable of destroying the North Koreans' tanks. They were unsuccessful; the result was 180 dead, wounded, or taken prisoner. The KPA progressed southwards, pushing back the U.S. force at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Pyongtaek" title="Battle of Pyongtaek">Pyongtaek</a>, <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Chonan" title="Battle of Chonan">Chonan</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Chochiwon" title="Battle of Chochiwon">Chochiwon</a>, forcing the 24th Division's retreat to <a href="/wiki/Daejeon" title="Daejeon">Taejeon</a>, which the KPA captured in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Taejon" title="Battle of Taejon">Battle of Taejon</a>; the 24th Division suffered 3,602 dead and wounded and 2,962 captured, including the Division's Commander, Major General <a href="/wiki/William_F._Dean" title="William F.

<p>By August, the KPA steadily pushed back the ROK Army and the <a href="/wiki/Eighth_United_States_Army" title="Eighth United States Army">Eighth United States Army</a> southwards.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStokesbury199053_150-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStokesbury199053-150">[148]</a></sup> The impact of the Truman administration's defense budget cutbacks were now keenly felt, as U.S. troops fought a series of costly rearguard actions. Lacking sufficient anti-tank weapons, artillery or armor, they were driven down the Korean peninsula.<sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-151">[149]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-152">[150]</a></sup> During their advance, the KPA purged the Republic of Korea's intelligentsia by killing civil servants and intellectuals. On 20 August, General MacArthur warned North Korean leader Kim Il-sung he was responsible for the KPA's atrocities.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStokesbury199056_153-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStokesbury199056-153">[151]</a></sup> By September, UN forces were hemmed into a small corner of southeast Korea, near <a href="/wiki/Busan" title="Busan">Pusan</a>.

<p>Although Kim's early successes led him to predict he would end the war by the end of August, Chinese leaders were more pessimistic. To counter a possible U.S. deployment, Zhou Enlai secured a Soviet commitment to have the Soviet Union support Chinese forces with air cover, and deployed 260,000 soldiers along the Korean border, under the command of <a href="/wiki/Gao_Gang" title="Gao Gang">Gao Gang</a>. Zhou commanded Chai Chengwen to conduct a topographical survey of Korea, and directed Lei Yingfu, Zhou's military advisor in Korea, to analyze the military situation in Korea. Lei concluded that <a href="/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur" title="Douglas MacArthur">MacArthur</a> would most likely attempt a landing at <a href="/wiki/Incheon" title="Incheon">Incheon</a>. After conferring with Mao that this would be MacArthur's most likely strategy, Zhou briefed Soviet and North Korean advisers of Lei's findings, and issued orders to Chinese army commanders deployed on the Korean border to prepare for U.S. naval activity in the <a href="/wiki/Korea_Strait" title="Korea Strait">Korea Strait</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBarnouinYu2006141_154-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBarnouinYu2006141-154">[152]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the resulting <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Pusan_Perimeter" title="Battle of Pusan Perimeter">Battle of Pusan Perimeter</a> (August–September 1950), the U.S. Army withstood KPA attacks meant to capture the city at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Naktong_Bulge" class="mw-redirect" title="Battle of Naktong Bulge">the Naktong Bulge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_P%27ohang-dong" title="Battle of P'ohang-dong">P'ohang-dong</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Taegu" title="Battle of Taegu">Taegu</a>.
