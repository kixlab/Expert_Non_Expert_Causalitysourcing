<p>The Korean War was the first war in which <a href="/wiki/Jet_aircraft" title="Jet aircraft">jet aircraft</a> played the central role in air combat. Once-formidable fighters such as the <a href="/wiki/P-51_Mustang" class="mw-redirect" title="P-51 Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a>, <a href="/wiki/F4U_Corsair" class="mw-redirect" title="F4U Corsair">F4U Corsair</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hawker_Sea_Fury" title="Hawker Sea Fury">Hawker Sea Fury</a><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStokesbury1990174_297-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStokesbury1990174-297">[294]</a></sup>—all <a href="/wiki/Reciprocating_engine" title="Reciprocating engine">piston-engined</a>, propeller-driven, and designed during World War II—relinquished their air-superiority roles to a new generation of faster, <a href="/wiki/Turbojet" title="Turbojet">jet-powered</a> fighters arriving in the theater. For the initial months of the war, the <a href="/wiki/P-80_Shooting_Star" class="mw-redirect" title="P-80 Shooting Star">P-80 Shooting Star</a>, <a href="/wiki/F9F_Panther" class="mw-redirect" title="F9F Panther">F9F Panther</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gloster_Meteor#Service_during_the_Korean_War" title="Gloster Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a> and other jets under the UN flag dominated North Korea's prop-driven air force of Soviet <a href="/wiki/Yakovlev_Yak-9" title="Yakovlev Yak-9">Yakovlev Yak-9</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lavochkin_La-9" title="Lavochkin La-9">Lavochkin La-9s</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStokesbury1990182_298-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStokesbury1990182-298">[295]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWerrell200571_299-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWerrell200571-299">[296]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Chinese intervention in late October 1950 bolstered the <a href="/wiki/Korean_People%27s_Air_Force" class="mw-redirect" title="Korean People's Air Force">Korean People's Air Force</a> (KPAF) of North Korea with the <a href="/wiki/MiG-15" class="mw-redirect" title="MiG-15">MiG-15</a>, one of the world's most advanced jet fighters.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStokesbury1990182_298-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStokesbury1990182-298">[295]</a></sup> The heavily armed MiGs were faster than first-generation UN jets and so could reach and destroy U.S. <a href="/wiki/B-29_Superfortress" class="mw-redirect" title="B-29 Superfortress">B-29 Superfortress</a> bomber flights despite their fighter escorts. With increasing B-29 losses, the Air Force was forced to switch from a daylight bombing campaign to a safer but less accurate nighttime bombing of targets.</p>

<p>The USAF countered the MiG-15 by sending over three squadrons of its most capable fighter, the <a href="/wiki/F-86_Sabre" class="mw-redirect" title="F-86 Sabre">F-86 Sabre</a>. These arrived in December 1950.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStokesbury1990183_300-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStokesbury1990183-300">[297]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWerrell200576.E2.80.9377_301-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWerrell200576.E2.80.9377-301">[298]</a></sup> The MiG was designed as a bomber interceptor. It had a very high <a href="/wiki/Ceiling_(aeronautics)" title="Ceiling (aeronautics)">service ceiling</a>—15,000&nbsp;m (50,000&nbsp;ft) and carried very heavy weaponry: one 37&nbsp;mm cannon and two 23&nbsp;mm cannons. The F-86 had a ceiling of 13,000&nbsp;m (42,000&nbsp;ft) and were armed with six .50 caliber (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns, which were range adjusted by radar <a href="/wiki/Gunsights#Aircraft_gunsights" class="mw-redirect" title="Gunsights">gunsights</a>. If coming in at higher altitude the advantage of engaging or not went to the MiG. Once in a level flight <a href="/wiki/Dogfight" title="Dogfight">dogfight</a>, both swept-wing designs attained comparable maximum speeds of around 1,100&nbsp;km/h (660&nbsp;mph). The MiG climbed faster, but the Sabre turned and dived better.<sup id="cite_ref-Sherman2000_302-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sherman2000-302">[299]</a></sup></p>

<p>In summer and autumn 1951, the outnumbered Sabres of the USAF's <a href="/wiki/4th_Fighter_Wing" title="4th Fighter Wing">4th Fighter Interceptor Wing</a>—only 44 at one point—continued seeking battle in <a href="/wiki/MiG_Alley" title="MiG Alley">MiG Alley</a>, where the <a href="/wiki/Yalu_River" title="Yalu River">Yalu River</a> marks the Chinese border, against Chinese and North Korean air forces capable of deploying some 500 aircraft.

<p>Unlike the Vietnam War, in which the Soviet Union only officially sent "advisers", in the Korean aerial war Soviet forces participated via the 64th Airborne Corps. Fearful of confronting the United States directly, the Soviet Union denied involvement of their personnel in anything other than an advisory role, but air combat quickly resulted in Soviet pilots dropping their code signals and speaking over the wireless in Russian. This known direct Soviet participation was a <i><a href="/wiki/Casus_belli" title="Casus belli">casus belli</a></i> that the UN Command deliberately overlooked, lest the war for the Korean peninsula expand to include the Soviet Union, and potentially escalate into atomic warfare.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStokesbury1990182_298-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStokesbury1990182-298">[295]</a></sup> 1,106 enemy airplanes were officially downed by the Soviet pilots, 52 of whom got ace status. The Soviet system of confirming air kills erred on the conservative side; the pilot's words had to be corroborated and enemy aircraft falling into the sea were not counted, the number might exceed 1,106.<sup id="cite_ref-airwar.ru.2Fhistory_304-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-airwar.ru.2Fhistory-304">[301]</a></sup></p>

<p>After the war, and to the present day, the USAF reports an F-86 Sabre <a href="/wiki/Loss_exchange_ratio" title="Loss exchange ratio">kill ratio</a> in excess of 10:1, with 792 MiG-15s and 108 other aircraft shot down by Sabres, and 78 Sabres lost to enemy fire.<sup id="cite_ref-Puckett2005_305-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Puckett2005-305">[302]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-306" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-306">[303]</a></sup> The Soviet Air Force reported some 1,100 air-to-air victories and 335 MiG combat losses, while China's <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Air_Force" title="People's Liberation Army Air Force">People's Liberation Army Air Force</a> (PLAAF) reported 231 combat losses, mostly MiG-15s, and 168 other aircraft lost. The KPAF reported no data, but the UN Command estimates some 200 KPAF aircraft lost in the war's first stage, and 70 additional aircraft after the Chinese intervention. The USAF disputes Soviet and Chinese claims of 650 and 211 downed F-86s, respectively. However, one source claims that the U.S. Air Force has more recently cited 224 losses (c.100 to air combat) out of 674 F-86s deployed to Korea.<sup id="cite_ref-307" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-307">[304]</a></sup></p>
