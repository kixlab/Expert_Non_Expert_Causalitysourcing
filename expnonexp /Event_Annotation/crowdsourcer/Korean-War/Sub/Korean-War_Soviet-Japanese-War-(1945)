He noted that he was "faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available, and time and space factors, which would make it difficult to reach very far north, before Soviet troops could enter the area".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGoulden198317_64-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoulden198317-64">[62]</a></sup> As Rusk's comments indicate, the U.S. doubted whether the Soviet government would agree to this.<sup id="cite_ref-McCullough1992_65-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-McCullough1992-65">[63]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAppleman1998_66-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAppleman1998-66">[64]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-McCune1946_67-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-McCune1946-67">[65]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Grajdanzev1945_68-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Grajdanzev1945-68">[66]</a></sup> Stalin, however, maintained his wartime policy of co-operation, and on 16 August the Red Army halted at the 38th parallel for three weeks to await the arrival of U.S. forces in the south.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStokesbury199024.2C_25_63-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStokesbury199024.2C_25-63">[61]</a></sup></p>
