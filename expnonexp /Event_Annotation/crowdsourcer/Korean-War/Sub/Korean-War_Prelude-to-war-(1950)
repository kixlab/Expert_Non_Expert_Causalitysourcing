<p>By 1949, South Korean forces had reduced the active number of communist guerrillas in the South from 5,000 to 1,000. However, Kim Il-sung believed that the guerrillas weakened the South Korean military and that a North Korean invasion would be welcomed by much of the South Korean population. Kim began seeking Stalin's support for an invasion in March 1949, traveling to Moscow to attempt to persuade him.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWeathersby20023.E2.80.934_91-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWeathersby20023.E2.80.934-91">[89]</a></sup></p>

<p>Stalin initially did not think the time was right for a war in Korea. Chinese Communist forces were still embroiled in the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War" title="Chinese Civil War">Chinese Civil War</a>, while U.S. forces remained stationed in South Korea.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWeathersby20023_92-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWeathersby20023-92">[90]</a></sup> By spring 1950, he believed that the strategic situation had changed: Mao's Communist forces had secured final victory in China, U.S. forces had withdrawn from Korea, and the Soviets <a href="/wiki/Soviet_atomic_bomb_project" title="Soviet atomic bomb project">detonated their first nuclear bomb</a>, breaking the U.S. atomic monopoly. As the U.S. had not directly intervened to stop the communist victory in China, Stalin calculated that they would be even less willing to fight in Korea, which had much less strategic significance. The Soviets had also cracked the codes used by the U.S. to communicate with their embassy in Moscow, and reading these dispatches convinced Stalin that Korea did not have the importance to the US that would warrant a nuclear confrontation.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWeathersby20029.2C_10_93-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWeathersby20029.2C_10-93">[91]</a></sup> Stalin began a more aggressive strategy in Asia based on these developments, including promising economic and military aid to China through the <a href="/wiki/Sino-Soviet_Treaty_of_Friendship,_Alliance_and_Mutual_Assistance" title="Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance">Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWeathersby200211_94-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWeathersby200211-94">[92]</a></sup></p>

<p>In April 1950, Stalin gave Kim permission to invade the South under the condition that Mao would agree to send reinforcements if needed. Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces would not openly engage in combat, to avoid a direct war with the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWeathersby200210_95-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWeathersby200210-95">[93]</a></sup> Kim met with Mao in May 1950.

<p>Soviet generals with extensive combat experience from the Second World War were sent to North Korea as the Soviet Advisory Group.
