<p>In occupied areas, North Korean Army <a href="/wiki/Political_commissar" title="Political commissar">political officers</a> purged South Korean society of its intelligentsia by executing every educated person—academic, governmental, religious—who might lead resistance against the North; the purges continued during the NPA retreat.<sup id="cite_ref-Rummel1997_32-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rummel1997-32">[31]</a></sup> When the North Koreans retreated north in September 1950, they abducted tens of thousands of South Korean men.

<p>In addition to conventional military operations, North Korean soldiers fought the UN forces by <a href="/wiki/Infiltration_tactics" title="Infiltration tactics">infiltrating</a> guerrillas among refugees. These soldiers disguised as refugees would approach UN forces asking for food and help, then open fire and attack. U.S. troops acted under a "shoot-first-ask-questions-later" policy against any civilian refugee approaching U.S. battlefield positions,<sup id="cite_ref-HanleyMendoza2006_346-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HanleyMendoza2006-346">[343]</a></sup> a policy that led U.S. soldiers to kill an estimated 400 civilians at <a href="/wiki/No_Gun_Ri" class="mw-redirect" title="No Gun Ri">No Gun Ri</a> (26–29 July 1950) in central Korea because they believed some of the refugees to be North Korean soldiers in disguise.<sup id="cite_ref-HanleyMendoza2007_347-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HanleyMendoza2007-347">[344]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_(South_Korea)" title="Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Korea)">South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a> defended this policy as a "military necessity".<sup id="cite_ref-348" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-348">[345]</a></sup></p>

<p>Beginning in 2005, the South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission has investigated numerous atrocities committed by the Japanese colonial government, North Korean military, U.S. military, and the authoritarian South Korean government. It has investigated atrocities before, during and after the Korean War.<sup id="cite_ref-349" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-349">[346]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Commission verified over 14,000 civilians were killed in the <a href="/wiki/Jeju_uprising" title="Jeju uprising">Jeju uprising</a> (1948–49) that involved South Korean military and paramilitary units against pro-North Korean guerrillas. Although most of the fighting subsided by 1949, it continued until 1950. The Commission estimates 86% of the civilians were killed by South Korean forces. The Americans on the island documented the events, but never intervened.<sup id="cite_ref-Newsweek2000_350-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Newsweek2000-350">[347]</a></sup></p>

<p>Although the Chinese rarely executed prisoners like their North Korean counterparts, mass starvation and diseases swept through the Chinese-run POW camps during the winter of 1950–51. About 43 percent of U.S. POWs died during this period. The Chinese defended their actions by stating that all Chinese soldiers during this period were suffering mass starvation and diseases due to logistical difficulties. The UN POWs said that most of the Chinese camps were located near the easily supplied Sino-Korean border, and that the Chinese withheld food to force the prisoners to accept the communism indoctrination programs.<sup id="cite_ref-Lech2000_365-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lech2000-365">[362]</a></sup> According to Chinese reports, over a thousand U.S. POWs died by the end of June 1951, while a dozen British POWs died, and all Turkish POW survived.<sup id="cite_ref-366" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-366">[363]</a></sup> According to Hastings, wounded U.S. POWs died for lack of medical attention and were fed a diet of corn and millet "devoid of vegetables, almost barren of proteins, minerals, or vitamins" with only 1/3 the calories of their usual diet.
