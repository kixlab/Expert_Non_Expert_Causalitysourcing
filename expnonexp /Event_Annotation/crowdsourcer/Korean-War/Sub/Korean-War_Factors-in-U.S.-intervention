<p>The Truman administration was unprepared for the invasion. Korea was not included in the strategic Asian Defense Perimeter outlined by Secretary of State <a href="/wiki/Dean_Acheson" title="Dean Acheson">Dean Acheson</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKim197330_127-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKim197330-127">[125]</a></sup> Truman himself was at his home in <a href="/wiki/Independence,_Missouri" title="Independence, Missouri">Independence, Missouri</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-upi19500624_128-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-upi19500624-128">[126]</a></sup> Military strategists were more concerned with the security of Europe against the Soviet Union than East Asia. At the same time, the administration was worried that a war in Korea could quickly widen into another world war should the Chinese or Soviets decide to get involved.</p>

<p>One facet of the changing attitude toward Korea and whether to get involved was Japan. Especially after the fall of China to the Communists, U.S. experts on East Asia saw Japan as the critical counterweight to the Soviet Union and China in the region. While there was no United States policy dealing with South Korea directly as a national interest, its proximity to Japan increased the importance of South Korea. Said Kim: "The recognition that the security of Japan required a non-hostile Korea led directly to President Truman's decision to intervene&nbsp;... The essential point&nbsp;... is that the American response to the North Korean attack stemmed from considerations of U.S. policy toward Japan."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKim197346_129-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKim197346-129">[127]</a></sup></p>

<p>Another major consideration was the possible Soviet reaction in the event that the U.S. intervened. The Truman administration was fretful that a war in Korea was a diversionary assault that would escalate to a general war in Europe once the United States committed in Korea. At the same time, "[t]here was no suggestion from anyone that the United Nations or the United States could back away from [the conflict]".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERees196422_130-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERees196422-130">[128]</a></sup> Yugoslavia—a possible Soviet target because of the <a href="/wiki/Tito%E2%80%93Stalin_Split" title="Tito–Stalin Split">Tito-Stalin Split</a>—was vital to the defense of Italy and Greece, and the country was first on the list of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council" title="United States National Security Council">National Security Council</a>'s post-North Korea invasion list of "chief danger spots".<sup id="cite_ref-schindler19980224_131-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-schindler19980224-131">[129]</a></sup> Truman believed if aggression went unchecked, a chain reaction would be initiated that would marginalize the United Nations and encourage Communist aggression elsewhere. The UN Security Council approved the use of force to help the South Koreans and the U.S. immediately began using what air and naval forces that were in the area to that end. The Truman administration still refrained from committing on the ground because some advisers believed the North Koreans could be stopped by air and naval power alone.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERees196423_132-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERees196423-132">[130]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Truman administration was still uncertain if the attack was a ploy by the Soviet Union or just a test of U.S. resolve. The decision to commit ground troops became viable when a communiqué was received on 27 June indicating the Soviet Union would not move against U.S. forces in Korea.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERees196426_133-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERees196426-133">[131]</a></sup> The Truman administration now believed it could intervene in Korea without undermining its commitments elsewhere.</p>
