<p>The initial assault by North Korean KPA forces was aided by the use of Soviet <a href="/wiki/T-34" title="T-34">T-34-85</a> tanks.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStokesbury199014.2C_43_286-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStokesbury199014.2C_43-286">[283]</a></sup> A North Korean <a href="/wiki/Tank_corps_(Soviet_Union)" title="Tank corps (Soviet Union)">tank corps</a> equipped with about 120 T-34s spearheaded the invasion. These drove against a ROK Army with few anti-tank weapons adequate to deal with the Soviet T-34s.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStokesbury199039_287-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStokesbury199039-287">[284]</a></sup> Additional Soviet armor was added as the offensive progressed.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPerrett1987134.E2.80.9335_288-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPerrett1987134.E2.80.9335-288">[285]</a></sup> The North Korean tanks had a good deal of early successes against South Korean infantry, elements of the <a href="/wiki/Task_Force_Smith" class="mw-redirect" title="Task Force Smith">24th Infantry Division</a>, and the United States built <a href="/wiki/M24_Chaffee" title="M24 Chaffee">M24 Chaffee</a> light tanks that they encountered.<sup id="cite_ref-289" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-289">[286]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStein199418_290-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStein199418-290">[287]</a></sup> Interdiction by ground attack aircraft was the only means of slowing the advancing Korean armor. The tide turned in favour of the United Nations forces in August 1950 when the North Koreans suffered major tank losses during a series of battles in which the UN forces brought heavier equipment to bear, including <a href="/wiki/M4_Sherman" title="M4 Sherman">M4A3 Sherman</a> medium tanks backed by <a href="/wiki/M26_Pershing" title="M26 Pershing">U.S. M26</a> heavy tanks, along with British <a href="/wiki/Centurion_tank" class="mw-redirect" title="Centurion tank">Centurion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Churchill_tank" title="Churchill tank">Churchill</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cromwell_tank" title="Cromwell tank">Cromwell</a> tanks.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStokesbury1990182.E2.80.9384_291-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStokesbury1990182.E2.80.9384-291">[288]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Inchon" title="Battle of Inchon">U.S. landings at Inchon</a> on 15 September cut off the North Korean supply lines, causing their armored forces and infantry to run out of fuel, ammunition, and other supplies. As a result, the North Koreans had to retreat, and many of the T-34s and heavy weapons had to be abandoned. By the time the North Koreans withdrew from the South, a total of 239 T-34s and 74 <a href="/wiki/SU-76" title="SU-76">SU-76s</a> were lost.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPerrett1987135_292-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPerrett1987135-292">[289]</a></sup> After November 1950, North Korean armor was rarely encountered.<sup id="cite_ref-293" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-293">[290]</a></sup></p>

<p>Following the initial assault by the north, the Korean War saw limited use of tanks and featured no large-scale tank battles. The mountainous, forested terrain, especially in the Eastern Central Zone, was poor tank country, limiting their mobility. Through the last two years of the war in Korea, UN tanks served largely as infantry support and mobile artillery pieces.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERavinoCarty2003130_294-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERavinoCarty2003130-294">[291]</a></sup></p>
