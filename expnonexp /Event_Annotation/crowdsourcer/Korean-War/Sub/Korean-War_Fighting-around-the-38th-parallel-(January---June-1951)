<p>With Lieutenant-General <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Ridgway" title="Matthew Ridgway">Matthew Ridgway</a> assuming the command of the U.S. Eighth Army on 26 December, the PVA and the KPA launched their <b>Third Phase Offensive</b> (also known as the "Chinese New Year's Offensive") on New Year's Eve of 1950. Utilizing night attacks in which UN Command fighting positions were encircled and then assaulted by numerically superior troops who had the element of surprise, the attacks were accompanied by loud trumpets and gongs, which fulfilled the double purpose of facilitating tactical communication and mentally disorienting the enemy. UN forces initially had no familiarity with this tactic, and as a result some soldiers panicked, abandoning their weapons and retreating to the south.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStokesbury1990117_217-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStokesbury1990117-217">[214]</a></sup> The Chinese New Year's Offensive overwhelmed UN forces, allowing the PVA and KPA to <a href="/wiki/Third_Battle_of_Seoul" title="Third Battle of Seoul">conquer Seoul</a> for the second time on 4 January 1951.</p>

<p>On 1 March 1951, Mao sent a cable to Stalin, in which he emphasized the difficulties faced by Chinese forces and the need for air cover, especially over supply lines. Apparently impressed by the Chinese war effort, Stalin agreed to supply two air force divisions, three anti-aircraft divisions, and six thousand trucks. PVA troops in Korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war. In late April Peng Dehuai sent his deputy, <a href="/wiki/Hong_Xuezhi" title="Hong Xuezhi">Hong Xuezhi</a>, to brief Zhou Enlai in Beijing. What Chinese soldiers feared, Hong said, was not the enemy, but having no food, bullets, or trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded. Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA's logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving supply methods, but these efforts were never sufficient. At the same time, large-scale air defense training programs were carried out, and the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Air_Force" title="People's Liberation Army Air Force">Chinese Air Force</a> began participating in the war from September 1951 onward.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBarnouinYu2006149_228-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBarnouinYu2006149-228">[225]</a></sup></p>

<p>MacArthur was relieved primarily from his determination to expand the war into China, which other officials believed would needlessly escalate a limited war and consume too many already overstretched resources. Despite MacArthur's claims that he was restricted to fighting a limited war when China was fighting all-out, congressional testimony revealed China was using restraint as much as the U.S. was, as they were not using air power against front-line troops, communication lines, ports, naval air forces, or staging bases in Japan, which had been crucial to the survival of UN forces in Korea. Simply fighting on the peninsula had already tied down significant portions of U.S. airpower; as <a href="/wiki/Chief_of_Staff_of_the_United_States_Air_Force" title="Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force">Air Force chief of staff</a> <a href="/wiki/Hoyt_Vandenberg" title="Hoyt Vandenberg">Hoyt Vandenberg</a> said, 80–85% the tactical capacity, one-fourth of the strategic portion, and 20% of air defense forces of the United States were engaged in a single country. There was also fear that crossing into China would provoke the Soviet Union into entering the war; General <a href="/wiki/Omar_Bradley" title="Omar Bradley">Omar Bradley</a> testified that there were 35 Russian divisions totaling some 500,000 troops in the Far East, which if sent into action with the approximately 85 Russian submarines in the vicinity of Korea, they could overwhelm U.S. forces and cut supply lines, as well as potentially assist China in taking over territory in Southeast Asia.<sup id="cite_ref-234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-234">[231]</a></sup></p>
